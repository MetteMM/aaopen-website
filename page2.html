            <p>
                I am Mette - a journalist, based in Copenhagen.
                I am currently learning how to code through App Academy,
                which is why I am making this website. It will hopefully improve
                with time.
            </p>
            <p>I have been a journalist since 2008, and I have worked the finance
            beat for more than ten years. My current job is as an editor for the news site FinansWatch,
                but at the moment I am on maternity leave. I decided to learn how to code while on maternity leave with
                my youngest son as a way of upgrading my skills.
