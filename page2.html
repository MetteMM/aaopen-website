                I am Mette - a journalist, based in Copenhagen.
                I am currently learning how to code through App Academy,
                which is why I am making this website. It will hopefully improve
                with time.

            <p>I have been a journalist since 2008, and I have worked the finance
            beat for more than ten years.</p>
            <p>My current job is as an editor for the news site FinansWatch,
                but at the moment I am on maternity leave.</p>
            <p>I decided to learn how to code while on maternity leave with
                my youngest as a way of upgrading my skills.
